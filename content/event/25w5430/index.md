### Description
The Banff International Research Station will host the “Wasserstein Gradient
Flows in Math and Machine Learning” workshop in Banff from June 29 - July 4,
2025.

Much of modern machine learning is based on optimization where one tries to find
parameters of a model that minimize loss. These optimization problems are then
solved numerically by running a dynamic algorithm. One of the major theoretical
difficulties is the scale of these problems. Modern data are huge in both their
dimension and their count. A proper understanding requires a mathematical theory
that is well suited to understand the effect of dimensions on these problems.
Wasserstein gradient flow is one such mathematical theory. Originally developed
for studying partial differential equations, in recent years it has appeared to
have the right tools to study a number of popular machine learning and data
science algorithms. The aim of this workshop is to bring together prominent
researchers from both mathematics and machine learning, along with a number
of young researchers, for an effective exchange of ideas and a flowering of
future research.

The Banff International Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and
Discovery (BIRS) is a collaborative Canada-US-Mexico venture that provides an
environment for creative interaction as well as the exchange of ideas,
knowledge, and methods within the Mathematical Sciences, with related
disciplines and with industry. The research station is located at The Banff
Centre in Alberta and is supported by Canada’s Natural Science and Engineering
Research Council (NSERC), the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), and
Alberta’s Advanced Education and Technology.
