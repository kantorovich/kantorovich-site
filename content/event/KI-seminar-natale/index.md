  In this talk, we study a variational problem that provides a way to extend
  minimizing geodesics connecting two given probability measures in the
  Wasserstein space for all times. This is achieved by allowing negative
  coefficients in the classical variational characterization of Wasserstein
  barycenters. Using Toland duality, we show that this problem is equivalent to
  a specific type of Wasserstein projection onto the set of measures dominated
  in the convex order by a given measure. We propose a computational approach to
  solve the problem, exploiting an explicit characterization of the convex set
  of discrete measures dominated in the convex order by an absolutely continuous
  measure. Finally, we give a concrete application of this in materials science,
  of fitting a Laguerre tessellation to an electron backscatter diffraction
  (EBSD) image of a steel.
