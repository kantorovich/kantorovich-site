#### Topic
This workshop brings together two exciting new directions in research: stochastic
transport and Wasserstein projections. Stochastic transport studies how
processes evolve over time rather than as instant shifts, making it particularly
useful for dynamic systems where decisions depend on the flow of information.
This perspective connects probability, geometry, and partial differential
equations and has proven powerful in understanding learning in neural networks,
development of cells, and the performance of algorithms. It also underpins
important advances in finance, risk management, and optimization, where choices
must be made sequentially and uncertainty plays a major role. Recent work has
introduced causal and adapted transport, which ensures models respect time and
available information, leading to robust ways of comparing systems. These
methods have already found wide-ranging applications and promise further
breakthroughs in dynamic, information-driven settings.

Wasserstein projections, on the other hand, address the problem of finding the
best-fitting model for observed data within a chosen class of models. This
approach is particularly important when robustness is required, such as in
economics or risk management. Though seemingly distinct from stochastic
transport, surprising connections have emerged, linking Wasserstein projections
to geometric inequalities, stochastic ordering of probability distributions, and
computational tools like the Sinkhorn algorithm. These intersections suggest
rich opportunities for advancing both theory and applications. The workshop’s
central aim is to create a platform where these two communities—often working
separately—can exchange ideas, spark collaborations, and explore their common
ground. By bringing together experts, early-career researchers, and students,
the workshop will foster new insights and collaborations that could reshape
classical areas of mathematics while also driving innovation in modern applied
fields.
