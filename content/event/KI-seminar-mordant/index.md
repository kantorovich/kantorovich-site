abstract: |
  In this talk, we will discuss the question of establishing CLTs for empirical
  entropic optimal transport when choosing the regularisation parameter as a
  decreasing function of the sample size. Importantly, decreasing the
  regularisation parameter enables estimating the population unregularized
  quantities of interest. Furthermore, we will show an application to score
  function estimation, a central quantity in diffusion models, and will discuss
  parallels with recent work on the estimation of transport maps based on the
  linearization of the Monge—Ampère equation.
