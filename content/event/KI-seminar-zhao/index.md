abstract: |
  Recent advances in experimental methodologies and large-scale community
  efforts have led to an explosion of single-cell genomics and imaging data,
  creating a need for new analytical frameworks capable of extracting meaningful
  structure and dynamics. In this talk, I will describe our recent efforts to
  leverage optimal transport, in combination with neural networks and kernel
  methods, to learn dynamical systems in cellular biology, with a specific focus
  on processes with invariance and/or equivariance. 

  In the first part, from a geometric perspective, I will present a sequence of
  metrics on shape spaces and demonstrate their application to quantifying
  morphological variability in cellular images during mitosis. This part is
  based on joint work with Danica J Sutherland (UBC CS) and Khanh Dao Duc (UBC
  math).

  In the second part, I will discuss a method for learning dynamics directly
  from single-cell transcriptomic data without temporal labels, using neural
  network architectures to uncover causal gene-regulatory relationships that
  govern cyclic processes such as the cell cycle. This part is based on joint
  work with Elana J. Fertig (UMD) and Genevieve Stein-O'Brien (JHU).
