abstract: |
  Lipschitz transport maps between two measures are useful tools for
  transferring analytical properties, such as functional inequalities. The most
  well-known result in this field is Caffarelliâ€™s contraction theorem, which
  shows that the optimal transport map from a Gaussian to a uniformly
  log-concave measure is globally Lipschitz. Note that the transfer of
  analytical properties does not depend on the optimality of the transport map.
  This is why several works have established Lipschitz bounds for other
  transport maps, such as those derived from diffusion processes, as introduced
  by Kim and Milman. Here, we use the control interpretation of the transport
  vector field inducing the transport map and a coupling strategy to obtain
  Lipschitz bounds for this map between asymptotically log-concave measures and
  their Lipschitz perturbations. This talk is based on a joint work with
  Giovanni Conforti.
