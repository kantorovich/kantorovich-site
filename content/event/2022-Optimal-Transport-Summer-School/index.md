title: "PIMS- IFDS- NSF Summer School on Optimal Transport"
event: "PIMS- IFDS- NSF Summer School on Optimal Transport"
subtitle: ""
location: University of Washington, Seattle

summary: |
 The common theme of this summer school is the mathematics of Monge-Kantorovich
 optimal transport (OT). The stunning mathematical development of OT has
 recently permeated into several fields of applications. Our speakers, chosen
 from the fields of analysis, biology, data science, economics, and probability,
 are leaders in their respective fields whose work intimately involves OT. Our
 goal is to expose talented students and junior researchers to the exciting and
 manifold research opportunities arising from OT and its applications, through
 attending lectures and interacting with the speakers as well as their peer
 participants. We strongly encourage participation by a diverse audience and
 welcome attendees from traditionally underrepresented socio-economic and
 cultural groups.

 As the school is planned at the beginning of the summer season in Seattle, the
 participants can also enjoy the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest and
 feel the energy of one of leading tech metropolises in the United States and
 around the world.

## Summer School in Optimal Transport

The common theme of this summer school is the mathematics of Monge-Kantorovich
optimal transport (OT). The stunning mathematical development of OT has recently
permeated into several fields of applications. Our speakers, chosen from the
fields of analysis, biology, data science, economics, and probability, are
leaders in their respective fields whose work intimately involves OT. Our goal
is to expose talented students and junior researchers to the exciting and
manifold research opportunities arising from OT and its applications, through
attending lectures and interacting with the speakers as well as their peer
participants. We strongly encourage participation by a diverse audience and
welcome attendees from traditionally underrepresented socio-economic and
cultural groups.

{{< detail-tag "Show Abstract" >}}
Gross substitutes is a fundamental property in mathematics, economics and
computation, almost as important as convexity. It is at the heart of optimal
transport theory -- although this is often underrecognized -- and understanding
the connection key to understanding the extension of optimal transport to other
models of matching.

  title="Recent results in interface motions in the framework of optimal  transport"
  author="Inwon Kim"
  affiliation="UCLA, USA"
  src="Inwon-Kim.jpg" >}}
{{< detail-tag "Show Abstract" >}}

In the lectures we will discuss recent results obtained on interface motions in
the framework of optimal transport. We intend to (time allowing) discuss the
following problems:

The Hele-Shaw type flows in the context of tumor growth. Here the flow describe
the growth of tumor cells with contact inhibition. The tumor cells then form a
congested zone, which evolves by the pressure generated by the constraint on
maximal density. We start with a simple mechanical model, and discuss the
effects of nutrients and surface tension in the context of minimizing movements.
While the well-posedness would be established by minimizing movements, we will
also explore qualitative properties of solutions such as regularity of the
interface.

The Stefan problem, in the framework of optimal stopping time. Our focus will be
on the well-posedness of the supercooled Stefan problem, which describes
freezing of supercooled fluid. The interface between the fluid and ice, as it
freezes, exhibits a high degree of irregularity. Our goal is to introduce a
notion of solutions that are physically meaningful and stable. We will start
with a quick introduction of the necessary background on the optimal stopping
time between probability measures. We will establish the well-posedness, and
discuss qualitative behavior of solutions.

{{< detail-tag "Show Abstract" >}}
In this lecture series we present an overview of dynamical optimal transport and
some of its applications to discrete probability and non-commutative analysis.
Particular focus is on gradient structures and functional inequalities for
dissipative quantum systems, and on homogenisation results for dynamical optimal
transport.

{{< abstract
  title="A variational approach to the regularity theory for optimal transportation"
  author="Felix Otto"
  affiliation="Max Planck Institute, Germany"
  src="felix-otto.jpg" >}}
{{< detail-tag "Show Abstract" >}}
In this mini-course, we shall explain the variational approach to regularity
theory for optimal transportation introduced in [8].  This approach does
completely bypass the celebrated regularity theory of Caffarelli [2], which is
based on the regularity theory for the Monge-Amp ere equation as a fully
nonlinear elliptic equation with a comparison principle.  Nonetheless, one
recovers the same partial regularity theory [5, 4].


The advantage of the variational approach resides in its robustness regarding
the regularity of the measures, which can be arbitrary measures [7][Theorem
1.4], and in terms of the problem formulation, e.g. by its extension to almost
minimizers [10].  The former for instance is crucial in order to tackle the
widely popular matching problem [3, 1] e.g. the optimal transportation between
(random) point clouds, as carried out in [7, 6, 9].  The latter is convenient
when treating more general than square Euclidean cost functions.

The variational approach follows de Giorgi's philosophy for minimal surfaces.
At its core is the approximation of the displacement by the gradient of a
harmonic function.  This approximation is based on the Eulerian formulation of
optimal transportation, which reveals its strict convexity and the proximity to
the $H^{-1}$-norm.  In this mini-course, we shall give a pretty self-contained
derivation of this harmonic approximation result, and establish applications to
the matching problem.

{{< detail-tag "Show Abstract" >}}
Optimal transport (OT) has recently gained lot of interest in machine learning.
It is a natural tool to compare in a geometrically faithful way probability
distributions. It finds applications in both supervised learning (using
geometric loss functions) and unsupervised learning (to perform generative model
fitting). OT is however plagued by the curse of dimensionality, since it might
require a number of samples which grows exponentially with the dimension. In
this course, I will explain how to leverage entropic regularization methods to
define computationally efficient loss functions, approximating OT with a better
sample complexity. More information and references can be found on the [website
of our book "Computational Optimal Transport"](https://optimaltransport.github.io/).

{{< detail-tag "Show Abstract" >}}
New measurement technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing are bringing ‘big
data’ to biology. One of the most exciting prospects associated with this new
trove of data is the possibility of studying temporal processes, such as
differentiation and development. In this talk, we introduce the basic elements
of a mathematical theory to answer questions like How does a stem cell transform
into a muscle cell, a skin cell, or a neuron? How can we reprogram a skin cell
into a neuron? We model a developing population of cells with a curve in the
space of probability distributions on a high-dimensional gene expression space.
We design algorithms to recover these curves from samples at various time-points
and we collaborate closely with experimentalists to test these ideas on real
data.
