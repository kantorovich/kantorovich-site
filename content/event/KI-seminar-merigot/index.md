abstract: |
  Stability results have important applications in statistics (including on the
  estimation of OT maps from random data, and the matching problem), in
  numerical analysis, and in data science. In particular, it justifies the
  "linearized optimal transport" framework, which embeds the quadratic
  Wasserstein space in a Hilbert space through the optimal transport map from a
  reference measure.

  In this talk, based on joint works with Alex Delalande and Cyril Letrouit, we
  present new quantitative stability results for quadratic optimal transport
  maps $T_\mu$ between a fixed source density $\rho$ and a target probability
  measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We establish that the map $\mu \mapsto
  T_\mu$ is bi-Hölder continuous with respect to the 2-Wasserstein distance
  under broad conditions on $\rho$. This include log-concave densities,
  densities on John domains, and some non-log-concave densities over the whole
  space. Our approach combines a local variance inequalities with innovative
  gluing techniques, leveraging tools such as Whitney decompositions and
  spectral graph theory to derive global stability bounds.
