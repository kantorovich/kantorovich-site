summary: |
  The CMS is organizing three-hour mini-courses to be held Friday June 4th.  One
  of these courses will be on "Optimal Transport and Stochastic Processes on
  Developmental Biology". This course may be of interest to the KI community.

abstract: |
  Optimal transport is a rapidly growing area of research at the intersection of
  probability, analysis, and optimization. It gives rise to powerful tools for
  comparing probability distributions and computing couplings between random
  variables, and it has found applications in physics, economics, statistics,
  machine learning and biology.

  This minicourse introduces the powerful computational and analytical tools of
  optimal transport and demonstrates how these concepts can be applied to analyze
  stochastic processes in biomedical data science. In addition to a self-contained
  introduction to the classical theory and the modern developments, we explain how
  concepts from optimal transport can be applied to model a developing population
  of cells as a curve in the space of probability distributions. We highlight new
  experimental technologies, like single cell RNA sequencing, that allow us to
  sample from these probability distributions, and we show how to use optimal
  transport to recover a developmental curve from samples at various time-points.
  We illustrate these concepts with an interactive tutorial, using real data from
  stem cell reprogramming.

  There will be two main speakers of this minicourse, Hugo Lavenant and Geoffrey
  Schiebinger.

  No knowledge of biology or optimal transport will be required. Familiarity
  with elementary concepts in probability theory and optimization might be
  helpful.
