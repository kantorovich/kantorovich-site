  Measures provide valuable insights into long-term and global behaviors across
  a broad range of dynamical systems. In this talk, we present our recent
  research efforts that employ measure theory and optimal transport to tackle
  core challenges in system identification, parameter recovery, and predictive
  modeling. First, we adopt a PDE-constrained optimization perspective to learn
  ODEs and SDEs from slowly sampled trajectories, enabling stable forward models
  and uncertainty quantification. We then use optimal transportation to align
  physical measures for parameter estimation, even when time-derivative data is
  unavailable. Our second result extends the celebrated Takensâ€™ time-delay
  embedding, a foundational result in dynamical systems, from state space to
  probability distributions. It establishes a robust theoretical and
  computational framework for state reconstruction that remains effective under
  noisy and partial observations. Finally, we show that by comparing invariant
  measures in time-delay coordinates, one can overcome identifiability
  challenges and achieve unique recovery of the underlying dynamics even though
  it is not generally possible to uniquely reconstruct dynamics using invariant
  statistics alone. Collectively, these works demonstrate how measure-theoretic
  and transport-based methods can robustly identify, analyze, and forecast
  real-world dynamical systems and the great research potential of
  measure-theoretic approaches for dynamical systems.
