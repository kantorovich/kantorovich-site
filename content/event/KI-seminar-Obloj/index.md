abstract: |
  Wasserstein distances, or Optimal Transport methods more generally, offer a
  powerful non-parametric toolbox to conceptualise and quantify model
  uncertainty in diverse applications. Importantly, they work across the
  spectrum: from small uncertainty around a selected model (e.g., the empirical
  measure) to large uncertainty of considering all models consistent with the
  data. I will showcase this using examples from mathematical finance (pricing
  and hedging of options, optimal investment) and statistics (non-parametric
  estimators, regularised regression methods). I will illustrate the large
  uncertainty regime using Martingale OT problems. For the small uncertainty
  regime I will consider a generic stochastic optimization problem and its
  distributionally robust version using Wasserstein balls. I will derive
  explicit formulae for the first order correction to both the value function
  and the optimizer. Throughout, I will present both theoretical result, as well
  as comments on the available numerical methods.

  The talk will be borrow from many joint works, including with Daniel Bartl,
  Samuel Drapeau, Stephan Eckstein, Gaoyue Guo, Tongseok Lim and Johannes
  Wiesel.
